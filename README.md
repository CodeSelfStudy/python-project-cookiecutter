# Python Project Cookiecutter

It's based on the project skeleton from [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex46.html) so that members can start new projects quickly.

Install cookiecutter in a Python 3 virtual environment:

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Create a new cookiecutter from this repo:

    $ cookiecutter gh:CodeSelfStudy/python-project-cookiecutter
